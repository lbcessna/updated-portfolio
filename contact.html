      <p>Hello, and welcome to my page!</p> <br>
      <p>I grew up on the Florida panhandle but I have called the beautiful Pacific Northwest my home for most of my adult life.</p> <br>
      <p>My professional life has taken me around the world. Literally! I spent 20 years of my life in the US Navy departing in 2015 at the rank of Chief Petty Officer.</p> <br>
      <p>I wanted to change gears and focus on IT. Upon my departure from Active Duty, I worked as an Incident Manager on Microsoft's Escalation Management team. From there I completed my Master of Science in Information/Project Management and began working as a Technincal Project Manager for UnitedHealth Group.</p> <br>
      <p>Now I'm pivoting to Web Development. Becoming a developer has been a dream of mine for a few years. So, I took the leap and applied for University of Washington's Full Stack Javascript bootcamp, which will be completed in November 2020.</p>
      <p>Feel free to look around at some of the projects that I'm proud of on <a href="https://github.com/lbcessna">Github</a>. Or even better, reach out and connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-cessna/">LinkedIn</a>!</p> <br>
